**Guidelines and Constraints:**
- MOST IMPORTANT: MAKE SMALL, MINIMAL, IMPACTFUL AND EFFECTIVE CODE CHANGES THAT SOLVE ONLY AND DIRECTLY THE PROBLEMS MENTIONED, THAT WONT AFFECT OUR EXISTING CODES FOR OTHER FEATURES. ALWAYS BE VERY CONSIDERATE ON MAKING SMALL AND EFFECTIVE CODE CHANGE.
- **Follow Existing Patterns**: Adhere strictly to the app's established architecture, including:
  - Use flutter_bloc (Cubit pattern) for state management in features like notifications and newsletters.
  - Leverage GoRouter for navigation, passing data via extra  parameters where needed.
  - Apply responsive design principles: Use MediaQuery and LayoutBuilder for adaptability; handle orientations (portrait for phones, landscape for tablets); avoid hardcoding dimensions—use theme and constraints for consistency.
  - Ensure UI consistency: Match the design of existing screens (e.g., newsletter screen with its app bar, background gradient, and content layout; notification screen with cards and bottom sheets). Use ThemeColorExtension for all colors and never hardcode values.
  - Dependency injection: Register and access services/repositories via GetIt (e.g., NewsletterCubit, NotificationsCubit).
  - Code quality: Run dart analyze  after every change and fix all errors caused by this session implementation, no need to fix warnings. Follow Effective Dart guidelines, including proper import organization and trailing commas.
- **Error Handling and Edge Cases**: Handle scenarios like invalid newsletter IDs, network failures, or missing metadata gracefully (e.g., show user-friendly messages or fallbacks). Ensure null safety and dispose of resources properly.
- **Performance and Best Practices**: Optimize for mobile performance, ensure smooth animations, and maintain modularity. Extract reusable widgets and avoid unnecessary rebuilds.
- **Testing and Review**: After implementation, verify functionality on different screen sizes, orientations, and themes. Ensure no breaking changes to existing features.
- **Restrictions**: Do not introduce new external dependencies without justification. Stick to native Flutter approaches for responsiveness and theming.


**Additional Notes:**
- Reference existing files for patterns (e.g., lib/features/notification/view/newsletter_screen.dart  for newsletter UI, lib/features/notification/view/notifications_screen.dart  for notification UI, and related Cubits for state logic).
- If any ambiguities arise (e.g., with metadata parsing or API responses), prioritize user experience and consult standard Flutter best practices.
- Output only the necessary code changes, explanations, or files—focus on clean, maintainable implementations.

Please implement these features accordingly and confirm once complete.

### NetMind — Code Review Standard (Project-Aware)

This rule enforces a rigorous, project-specific review for NetMind. Reviews must consider architecture, data, UI, theming, i18n, DI, routing, and reuse of existing patterns in this repository. Be precise, cite code, and provide actionable steps.

### Scope & Mindset
- Be an expert on NetMind. Assume features follow established patterns and enforce them.
- **Always score out of 10** with rationales. Be explicit and demanding; no vague comments.
- **Cite code** with context using the repository-aware citation block. Prefer pointing to concrete lines in the code under review and comparable existing files.

Example citation format (required):
```startLine:endLine:filepath
// cited code
```

### Mandatory Project Context Checks
When reviewing any change, verify ALL of the following:

- Architecture & Structure
  - **Feature module layout**: `lib/features/<feature>/{cubit,models,services,view,widgets}`. Avoid mixing view and logic.
  - **State management**: Use Cubit (`BaseCubit`) and Freezed for state. States carry `UIStatus` and immutable fields.
  - **Repository pattern**: Data access in `lib/data/repositories/<feature>/` with clear interfaces and implementations.
  - **Dependency Injection**: All services/repositories registered in `lib/injector/modules/*.dart` and resolved via `Injector.instance<T>()`.

- Data Layer & REST API
  - **Models**: Use `json_serializable` with `@JsonKey` for field names, provide `fromJson/toJson`. Regenerate with `build_runner`.
  - **HTTP**: Use Dio with configured interceptors from `dio_module.dart`; map errors via `NetworkExceptions`/`ApiException`.
  - **Retrofit/typed clients** (if applicable): Prefer typed API clients over raw calls; keep endpoints/constants centralized.
  - **Repositories**: No HTTP in UI/Cubit. Methods return typed results or domain models; handle pagination and SSE where applicable.

- UI Design & Composition
  - **Standard screen shell**: Keep the design pattern used across different screens of the app. Examples: `lib/features/login/view/login_screen.dart`, `lib/features/register/view/register_screen.dart`, `lib/features/chat/view/chatting_screen.dart`, `lib/features/first_time_guide/view/terms_screen.dart`, `lib/features/first_time_guide/view/personal_info_screen.dart`, and `lib/features/discover/view/discover_screen.dart`. Most future features will resembles / take some reference from existing screens, more of this will be specified in the prompt when needed.
  - **Theming**: Use `Theme.of(context).extension<ThemeColorExtension>()` for all colors; do not hardcode except specific gradients.
  - **Sizing/spacing**: Use `flutter_screenutil` (`.w`, `.h`, `.sp`) and reusable sizes from `AppThemes`/`AppSpacing`/`AppDimens`.
  - **Reusable components**: Prefer `lib/widgets/` and `packages/vtnet_components` for buttons, fields, labels, switches, dialogs, bottom sheets.
  - **Asset management**: Use generated `Assets.*` and `Utils.getImagePathWithTheme(...)` for theme-aware images.
  - **Localization**: All user-facing strings via `S.current.*`/`S.of(context).*`. Add keys to both `lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` and `lib/l10n/intl_vi.arb` with correct pluralization.
  - **Navigation**: Use `GoRouter` (`router/app_router.dart`). New screens registered and navigated with `context.pushNamed`/`context.go`.
  - **Orientation/responsiveness**: Handle landscape/portrait, tablets; compute app bar height accordingly; prefer `LayoutBuilder`.

- Error Handling & UX
  - Map network and API errors to friendly messages; reflect loading/error in `UIStatus` and UI states.
  - Dispose controllers and subscriptions; avoid memory leaks.

- Security & Config
  - Use services in `services/` for secure storage and token management; avoid direct access in UI.
  - Respect certificate pinning and environment config usage.

- Quality & Style
  - `dart analyze` is clean; imports ordered (Dart, Flutter, packages, project); use trailing commas; avoid `withOpacity()` (use `.withValues()` per project rule).

- Reuse & References
  - Reference prior art before creating new patterns. Examples:
    - Screen shell: `lib/features/login/view/login_screen.dart`, `lib/features/register/view/register_screen.dart`, `lib/features/chat/view/chatting_screen.dart`, `lib/features/first_time_guide/view/terms_screen.dart`/`personal_info_screen.dart`, and `lib/features/discover/view/discover_screen.dart` (header + gradient + rounded content)
    - Menu drawer patterns: `lib/features/menu_drawer/view/`
    - Bottom sheets: `Utils.showBottomSheet` usage across features (e.g., `lib/features/discover/view/`, feedback in `lib/features/chat/view/chatting_screen.dart`)
    - Theme usage and color extensions: `lib/core/themes/app_themes.dart`
  - If a new feature copies an existing pattern, prefer refactoring to shared widgets in `lib/widgets/`.

### Scoring Rubric (Total 10.0)
- Architecture & Structure: 1.8
- Data Layer & API (models, repositories, error mapping): 1.8
- UI Pattern Fidelity & Reuse of Existing Screens/Widgets: 1.8
- Theme, Assets & Localization: 1.4
- Responsiveness & Performance: 1.0
- DI & Routing correctness: 0.7
- Security considerations: 0.5
- Testing readiness (unit/widget hooks): 0.5
- Code quality & style (lint, imports, commas): 0.5

Provide a sub-score and justification for each category. The final score is the weighted sum.

### Required Review Output Format
1. **Overall Verdict**: One line with a short verdict and the total score, e.g., “Pass with changes — 7.9/10”.
2. **Category Breakdown**: For each rubric item, show the score and 1–3 bullet rationales with citations.
   - Include at least one reference to an existing file that demonstrates the correct pattern (when applicable), e.g., `lib/features/login/view/login_screen.dart`, `lib/features/chat/view/chatting_screen.dart`, or `lib/features/discover/view/discover_screen.dart`.
3. **Actionable Next Steps (ordered)**: Concrete edits the author should make. Reference files and components to reuse.
4. **Risk Assessment**: Briefly note potential regressions/perf/memory/i18n risks.

### Enforcement Details & Examples
- Screen shell must include:
  - App bar with theme-aware background image/gradient and correct heights.
  - Overlapping rounded content container using `ThemeColorExtension.surfaceNeutralDefaultRest`.
  - Example references: `lib/features/login/view/login_screen.dart`, `lib/features/register/view/register_screen.dart`, `lib/features/first_time_guide/view/terms_screen.dart`, and `lib/features/discover/view/discover_screen.dart` (header and Positioned content).
- New APIs:
  - DTO with `@JsonSerializable()`, `@JsonKey`, `fromJson/toJson`.
  - Repository method in `lib/data/repositories/<feature>/...` using Dio from the DI module; errors mapped to `NetworkExceptions` and surfaced to Cubit via `UIStatus`.
- New screens:
  - Place in `lib/features/<feature>/view/`, driving logic from a Cubit in `cubit/` and states via Freezed.
  - All strings via `S.current`/`S.of(context)`; no hardcoded text.
  - Dimensions via `ScreenUtil` (`.w/.h/.sp`).
  - Colors via `ThemeColorExtension`; never directly use raw color values except sanctioned gradients.
  - Navigation via GoRouter; add route in `router/app_router.dart`.
- Components:
  - Prefer `packages/vtnet_components` for buttons, text fields, dialogs; place feature-specific components under `widgets/`.

### Cross-References (for the reviewer)
- Project context: `.cursor/rules/project-context.mdc`
- Feature guides: `.cursor/rules/module-*.mdc` (e.g., `module-first-time-guide.mdc`)
- Architecture patterns seen in: `lib/core/base/`, `lib/core/bloc_core/`, `lib/injector/modules/`, `lib/router/app_router.dart`
- Theme system: `lib/core/themes/app_themes.dart`

### Reviewer Conduct
- Use evidence. Cite specific lines from both the change and the reference implementation.
- Suggest the precise edit locations and components to reuse.
- If a requirement is ambiguous, state the assumption and recommend alignment with existing patterns.

### Baseline Principle
Explicitly validate correctness; justify each critique; support with code citations and concrete improvement steps aligned with NetMind’s established architecture and design patterns.


*in short, I just want an unified design system and make the app as beautiful and aesthetically pleasing and modernly designed as possible. Finally, I tell you this a lot, but stay with me here, make the design as close as possible, as good as possible, and as match to the images provided as possible. Do your best, this is really really imporant, my life depends on it.
